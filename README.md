- Hit ENTER multiple times to generate an empty and basic package.json
- Install lodash
- Use this blog on lodash to understand the power
- lodash documentation
- Use this video to see how to use lodash
- Build a simple terminal app that uses these 5 suggested methods.
- Use fake data from Wk 6 and 7 or google fake data you can use. Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
- Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
- Use at least these methods: _.chunk(), _.reverse(), _.without(), _.shuffle(), _.pebbles()
- Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.
- TIP: use the data from wk 6, day 2 for arrays and objects to tinker with. Or google fake data.
